NOTE: CURRENTLY FOR UNIX SYSTEMS (LINUX, OSX) ONLY. All other operating systems, 
	the "javaCompile" script will not work since it requires a bash runtime.

To use:
	* Copy the JavaRun.sublime-package file to your 
	  .config/sublime-text-2/Installed Packages directory. In Linux, this
	  is in ~/.config/sublime-text-2; in OS X, you need to look in
	  ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/
	* Quit and restart Sublime Text 2
	* JavaRun should now be the default compiler option for all Java (.java)
	  and Habanero Java (.hj) files.

Current Issues:
	* CANNOT handle command line input (e.g. Scanner(System.in).nextLine() )
	* Compiling for Habanero Java has to be done multiple times, since it
	  is not guaranteed to get all the files in the correct order (can only
	  compile one file at a time)
