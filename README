NOTE: TERMBUILD IS CURRENTLY ONLY FUNCTION ON LINUX SYSTEMS. WINDOWS AND MAC
      SUPPORT COMING WHEN I HAVE TIME.

Installation of TermBuild:
	* Locate your Sublime Text 2 config folder:
		--> On Linux, ~/.config/sublime-text-2/
		--> On Windows, %APPDATA%\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\
		--> On Mac, ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/
	* Copy the TermBuild.sublime-package and Terminal.sublime-package files into
	  the "Installed Packages" subdirectory of the config folder
	* Quit and restart Sublime Text 2

Configuration:
	* Default options can be set in the TermBuildSettings.py file. NOTE: The
	  only options that are currently checked are default classpaths.

Default implementations:
	* JavaRun is a build system implemented in the classic Sublime Text 2 way;
	  Java files should build using JavaRun instead of the default Java.
	* TermBuild is keybound to Ctrl+Shift+r, and opens up a new terminal window
	  to run your file, prompting you for options as it does so.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
	* TermBuild is currently only functional in a Linux environment
	* TermBuild currently has support for only Java/JUnit and Python builds; all
	  others will have to be created from the ExtensionBuilder.py template
